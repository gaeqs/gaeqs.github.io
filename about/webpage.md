This webpage was made using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), having as a base the [eleventy high performance blog](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog) provided by google, and I will use it as a place to post information about my projects and my professional life.

If you want information about my projects, go to the [projects section](/projects). If you want to see the latest updates about my work, go to the [posts section](/posts).

The general information about me and my work can be found at the [main page](/) of this site. If you have any question about me, my projects or any other work please don't hesitate to ask!
