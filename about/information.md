I've been a programmer since 2014: I started learning Java and making Minecraft add-ons. From there, I stared learning more programming languages, APIs and frameworks.

Right now I'm able to use from high-level programming languages such as Java, Kotlin or C# to assembly languages such as MIPS32. This list is expanded frequently, making me able to learn any programming language easily.

My projects use a vast variety of APIs and frameworks: graphics libraries, application platforms and game engines are my speciality.

Thanks to my attachment to videogames and my work-in-progress university degree (a double degree mixing computer engineering and videogame design and development) I'm able to perform tasks from a vast collection of fields: from designing the UI/UX of an application to create a simulator of an instruction set.

My hobbies, projects and education allows me to have a proficient written and verbal communication in Spanish, English and Galician.
