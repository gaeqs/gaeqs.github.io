Hi! I'm Gael Rial, I'm a 21 years old **Computer engineer** and **Videogame developer** currently studying Videogame design and development + Computer Engineering at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.

I have been interested in computers since I was a child, and I learned my first programming language at the age of 14.

I'm currently living in Spain, being able to move to other countries if the situation requires it.

**[My latest project](/projects/JAMS/)** is a MIPS32r6 editor, assembler and simulator made from scratch using the latest technologies in the Java environment.
