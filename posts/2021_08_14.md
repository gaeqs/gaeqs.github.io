## A new JAMS version is available!

![0.1-BETA](/img/JAMS/update/0.2-BETA.png)

This is the second BETA version of JAMS. This update introduces a lot of code cleanup and modularization.
This was able thanks to NES4JAMS, the NES emulation plugin I've working on the past few months.

## Changelog:

### Features
- New improved icon system. Icons now have a beautiful, smooth look thanks to a new render pipeline.
- Plugin support for almost every feature: languages, themes, bars, projects...
- New task API.
- New file litsener API.
- New MIPS instructions: traps, xor, xori.
- New find and replace editor features.
- New bar at the bottom of the main window with new features.
- Now you can sort the files to assemble.
- Big optimizations. Simulators don't allocate heap memory if events are not enabled.
- Full code cleanup.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug that prevented the simulation from being stopped if it was waiting for synchronization.
- Fixed a bug in some numeric value editors that prevented the user from setting the default value again.
- Fixed an error that appeared when a NOP out of bounds was executed.
- Fixed a memory leak that prevented working panes form being destroyed.
- Fixed a bug that prevented 'out' files to be omitted in a ProjectFolderExplorer.
